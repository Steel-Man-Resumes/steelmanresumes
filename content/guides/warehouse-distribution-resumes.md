# Warehouse & Distribution Resumes: What Actually Gets You Hired

*Forget the fancy templates. Here's what warehouse hiring managers actually want to see.*

---

You're not applying for a corporate desk job. You don't need a two-page resume with a "professional summary" about your "passion for logistics excellence."

You need a resume that shows you can show up, work hard, hit your numbers, and not break anything.

Warehouse and distribution hiring is straightforward: **Can you do the job? Are you reliable? Do you have the skills and certifications we need?**

This guide covers exactly what to put on your warehouse resume, what keywords to include, how to list your experience (including temp work), and what mistakes get resumes tossed.

## What Warehouse Employers Actually Look For

### Hard Skills That Matter

1. **Equipment operation** — Forklift (various types), pallet jack, RF scanners
2. **Core warehouse tasks** — Picking, packing, loading/unloading, shipping/receiving
3. **Inventory skills** — Cycle counting, inventory control, stock organization
4. **System knowledge** — WMS navigation, RF/handheld scanners, label printers
5. **Safety compliance** — OSHA awareness, proper lifting, PPE usage

### Soft Skills That Matter

1. **Reliability** — Will you show up? Every day? On time?
2. **Safety focus** — Can you work without getting hurt or hurting others?
3. **Attention to detail** — Can you pick the right items and count accurately?
4. **Teamwork** — Can you work alongside others without drama?
5. **Punctuality** — This is huge. Warehouses run on schedules.

### Certifications That Help

- **Forklift certification** (OSHA-compliant) — Top differentiator
- **OSHA-10 General Industry** — Shows safety awareness
- **Specific equipment training** — Reach truck, order picker, etc.

## Keywords Your Resume Needs

Large distribution centers (Amazon, Walmart, Target, FedEx, UPS, DHL) use **Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)** to screen resumes. If you don't have the right keywords, a human may never see your application.

### Must-Have Keywords

**Equipment:**
- Forklift / forklift operator
- Pallet jack / electric pallet jack
- RF scanner / handheld scanner
- Reach truck
- Order picker
- Cherry picker

**Tasks:**
- Order picking / pick and pack
- Shipping and receiving
- Loading / unloading
- Inventory control
- Cycle counting
- Palletizing
- Quality control

**Systems:**
- Warehouse Management System (WMS)
- SAP
- Oracle
- Manhattan Associates
- RF scanning

**Safety:**
- OSHA compliance
- Safety procedures
- PPE
- Forklift certified

**Metrics:**
- Units per hour
- Pick rate
- Inventory accuracy
- On-time shipping

### Pro Tip

Look at the job posting. Whatever words they use, use those same words on your resume. If they say "material handler," don't just say "warehouse worker."

---

## Equipment to List on Your Resume

Be specific. "Forklift experience" is vague. List exactly what you've operated:

### Forklift Types

- **Counterbalance forklift (sit-down)** — Most common
- **Stand-up reach truck** — High-rack warehouse work
- **Order picker / cherry picker** — Elevated picking
- **Walkie rider / electric pallet jack** — Floor-level transport
- **Turret truck** — Very narrow aisle operations

### Other Equipment

- Manual pallet jack
- Powered pallet jack
- RF / handheld scanners
- Label printers
- Conveyor systems
- Shrink wrap machines
- Dock plates / levelers

### Systems

If you've used any warehouse management systems, list them:
- SAP
- Oracle WMS
- Manhattan Associates
- Blue Yonder
- Company-specific systems (name them)

## Metrics That Get You Hired

Warehouse work is measurable. Employers want numbers, not just task lists.

### Key Metrics to Include

- **Pick rate / units per hour** — How fast you work
- **Accuracy rate** — How often you get it right
- **Volume** — How much you handle per shift/day
- **Error rate** — Zero errors is impressive
- **Trucks loaded/unloaded** — Throughput measure

### Strong Resume Bullets (Examples)

**Picking/Packing:**
> "Picked and packed 1,200+ items daily with 99% accuracy rate"

> "Maintained pick rate of 150 units/hour, ranking in top 5% of team"

> "Processed 1,200+ units nightly with 99.8% accuracy while operating RF scanning equipment"

**Forklift/Loading:**
> "Loaded and unloaded 15+ trucks per day, increasing shipping efficiency by 30%"

> "Moved and organized 2,000 kg of inventory per shift using sit-down forklift and pallet jacks"

> "Operated stand-up reach truck to stock and retrieve pallets in 40-foot racking system"

**Inventory:**
> "Conducted weekly cycle counts using RF scanners, achieving 99.9% inventory accuracy"

> "Reduced inventory discrepancies by 25% through improved receiving and binning procedures"

**General:**
> "Maintained zero safety incidents over 18 months while operating heavy equipment"

> "Trained 5 new hires on RF scanning, picking procedures, and safety protocols"

## Resume Format for Warehouse Jobs

Keep it simple. Warehouse hiring managers don't want fancy designs. They want clear, scannable information.

### Basic Structure

**Header:**
- Name
- Phone
- Email
- City, State (no full address needed)

**Skills Section (Top):**
- List equipment, certifications, and key skills
- Make it easy to scan in 5 seconds

**Work Experience:**
- Company name, job title, dates
- Bullet points with metrics
- Most recent first

**Education (Optional):**
- High school or GED is fine
- Training programs or certifications

### One Page

Unless you have 15+ years of directly relevant experience, keep it to one page. Hiring managers spend seconds on each resume.

---

## Entry-Level: No Warehouse Experience?

You can still get hired. Here's how to build your resume:

### Highlight Transferable Experience

Any job involving:
- Physical labor
- Moving or stocking items
- Inventory or counting
- Operating equipment
- Working on your feet

Relevant roles: retail stock, restaurant work, landscaping, moving companies, construction labor, farm work, volunteer work.

### Emphasize Reliability

- Attendance record
- Punctuality
- Willingness to work overtime
- Flexible schedule

### Include Any Equipment Exposure

Even basic experience counts:
- Pallet jacks (manual or powered)
- Hand trucks / dollies
- Basic inventory counting
- Any machinery operation

### Sample Entry-Level Bullet

> "Stocked shelves and organized backroom inventory at [Retail Store], consistently meeting daily stocking quotas while maintaining organized storage areas"

> "Loaded and unloaded delivery trucks at [Restaurant], handling 50+ lb cases in fast-paced environment"

---

## Experienced Workers: How to Stand Out

If you've been in warehouses for years, differentiate yourself:

### Show Multi-Equipment Proficiency

> "Certified to operate sit-down counterbalance, stand-up reach truck, and order picker forklifts"

### Highlight Leadership

> "Trained 12 new warehouse associates on picking procedures, RF scanning, and safety protocols"

> "Served as shift lead, coordinating 8-person team to meet daily shipping deadlines"

### Show Process Improvement

> "Identified and implemented new binning system that reduced picking time by 15%"

> "Reduced product damage by 20% through improved loading procedures"

### Add Certifications

- Forklift (specify types)
- OSHA-10 or OSHA-30
- First Aid/CPR
- Hazmat handling (if applicable)

## How to List Temp and Staffing Agency Experience

Temp work is normal in warehouses. List it clearly.

### Format

> **Warehouse Associate**  
> ABC Staffing (assigned to XYZ Distribution Center)  
> March 2024 – September 2024

Then add your bullet points underneath, just like any other job.

### Multiple Short Assignments

If you had several temp assignments, you can group them:

> **Warehouse Associate / Material Handler**  
> Various assignments through Express Employment Professionals  
> January 2024 – Present
>
> - Completed assignments at Amazon FC, Target DC, and regional 3PLs
> - Operated RF scanners and pallet jacks across multiple WMS platforms
> - Maintained 98%+ accuracy across all placements

### What Agencies Want to See

Staffing agencies look for:
- Ability to hit productivity and accuracy metrics
- Reliability across multiple assignments
- Flexibility with shifts and environments
- Quick learner who adapts to new sites

---

## Physical Requirements: Should You Mention Them?

Yes — briefly and factually.

Most warehouse jobs require:
- Lifting 50+ lbs repeatedly
- Standing 8-10 hours
- Bending, stooping, reaching
- Working in various temperatures (some DCs are cold storage)

### How to Include

Add a line in your skills section or at the bottom:

> "Able to lift 50-75 lbs repeatedly; comfortable standing and walking 8-10 hour shifts"

Or weave it into bullets:

> "Loaded trucks with cases weighing up to 70 lbs throughout 10-hour shifts"

### Why It Matters

Employers verify physical requirements through:
- Pre-hire questionnaires
- Post-offer physicals
- Functional capacity tests

Don't claim you can lift more than you actually can — you may be tested.

## Common Mistakes That Get Resumes Rejected

### 1. No Metrics

**Bad:** "Picked orders in warehouse"

**Good:** "Picked 150+ orders per shift with 99.5% accuracy"

### 2. Missing Equipment/Systems

**Bad:** "Operated warehouse equipment"

**Good:** "Operated sit-down forklift, electric pallet jack, and RF scanners using SAP WMS"

### 3. Generic Skills Without Context

**Bad:** "Hard worker, team player"

**Good:** "Consistently exceeded pick rate targets while maintaining zero safety incidents"

### 4. Unexplained Job Gaps or Short Stints

If you have gaps or lots of short jobs, address them:
- Group temp assignments together
- Note if positions were seasonal or contract
- Be ready to explain in the interview

### 5. Missing Keywords

If the job posting says "material handler" and your resume only says "warehouse worker," the ATS might not match you.

### 6. Typos and Sloppy Formatting

Warehouse managers may not care about fancy design, but typos and messy formatting signal carelessness.

- National median advertised wage: **$19.05/hour** for warehouse/logistics roles
- Higher rates in high-demand markets

### Automation Reality

Yes, automation is coming. But:
- Most warehouses use a hybrid model (people + technology)

- BLS projects continued job openings due to turnover and replacement needs
- Forklift and equipment skills remain valuable in automated environments

### Bottom Line

Warehouse jobs aren't disappearing. They're evolving. Workers with equipment skills, system knowledge, and strong metrics will continue to find work.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need a resume for warehouse jobs, or just an application?

Both help. Many employers accept just applications, but having a resume makes you look more prepared and gives you an advantage — especially for better positions or direct hire.

### Should I include a summary or objective?

Optional. If you do, keep it to one line focused on what you offer:

> "Forklift-certified warehouse associate with 3+ years experience in high-volume distribution, 99% accuracy rate"

Skip the fluff about "seeking opportunities to grow."

### How far back should my work history go?

10 years max. Focus on relevant experience. If your older jobs aren't warehouse-related, you can summarize or omit them.

### What if I was fired from a warehouse job?

Don't mention it on the resume. List the job normally. Be prepared to address it in the interview if asked. (See our [interview scripts guide](/guides/interview-scripts).)

### Should I list every temp assignment separately?

If you had many short assignments, group them under the staffing agency. If you had a few longer ones (3+ months), list them separately to show stability.

---

## The Bottom Line

Warehouse resumes are about clarity, metrics, and keywords.

**Show them:**
- What equipment you can operate
- How fast and accurate you are (with numbers)
- That you're reliable and safety-conscious
- The certifications you have

**Keep it:**
- One page
- Simple format
- Keyword-rich for ATS
- Specific, not generic

The job market for warehouse workers is strong. A clear, metric-driven resume gets you in the door.
