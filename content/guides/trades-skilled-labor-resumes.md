# Trades & Skilled Labor Resumes: How to Present Your Skills When You Work With Your Hands

*Your work speaks for itself. Your resume needs to speak for it too.*

---

You're not a desk jockey. You bend pipe, pull wire, weld steel, or run refrigerant. You work with your hands, solve real problems, and build things that matter.

But when it's time to put that on paper? Most trades workers struggle. They either write generic job duties that don't show their real skills, or they leave out the certifications and project details that actually get them hired.

This guide covers how to write a trades resume that works — whether you're an apprentice, journeyman, or master. We'll cover what to include for electricians, plumbers, HVAC techs, welders, and general construction, plus how to list licenses, show project scope, and handle union experience.

## What Trades Employers Actually Look For

### On Your Resume

1. **Documented trade skills** — Specific techniques, systems, code knowledge
2. **Current licenses and certifications** — State licenses, EPA 608, AWS, etc.
3. **Project experience** — Type, size, complexity, your role
4. **Safety record** — This matters more than you think
5. **Reliability** — Work history that shows you stick around

### Certifications vs. Experience

Both matter. But understand this:

- **Licensure is mandatory** in regulated trades (electrical, plumbing, HVAC refrigerant work)
- **Experience and productivity** drive pay and advancement
- Without the license, you can't legally do certain work — period

### Soft Skills That Matter

- **Dependability** — Show up. Every day. On time.
- **Communication** — With crews, customers, inspectors
- **Problem-solving** — Troubleshooting is the job
- **Safety mindset** — Nobody wants to hire a liability
- **Willingness to learn** — Codes change. Technology changes.

## How to Show Project Scope

Trades employers want to know what kind of work you've done. Show them.

### Include These Details

- **Project type:** Residential, commercial, industrial, institutional
- **Size/scale:** Square footage, number of units, crew size
- **Systems:** What you specifically worked on
- **Your role:** Helper, journeyman, lead, foreman

### Examples

> "**Commercial New Construction** — 200,000 sq ft warehouse, 10-person crew. Responsible for main electrical distribution rough-in and lighting circuits."

> "**Residential Service** — Handled 10-15 service calls/day including drain cleaning, fixture replacement, and water heater installs."

> "**Industrial Shutdown** — Welded pipe repairs on refinery turnaround project, working 12-hour shifts for 3-week duration."

> "**Multifamily** — Complete plumbing rough-in and finish for 40-unit apartment building, from underground to fixtures."

### Naming Clients/Projects

It's common to name projects in construction, especially well-known buildings or public work. But:
- Don't name clients if bound by NDA
- Don't include security-sensitive details
- Using project type and size is usually enough

---

## Union vs. Non-Union

### How to List Union Membership

> **Member, IBEW Local 494** — Inside Wireman, 2020–Present

> **UA Local 75 Journeyman Plumber** — State-registered apprenticeship completed 2022

### Union Hiring Halls and Resumes

Union halls dispatch members based on out-of-work lists and contractor requests. You might wonder: "Do I even need a resume?"

**Yes.** Having a current resume helps when:
- Contractors request specific skills or experience
- You're applying for foreman or supervisor roles
- You're seeking work outside the hall
- You want to document your full experience

### What Union and Non-Union Employers Both Want

- Skills
- Safety
- Reliability

**Differences:**
- Non-union shops often emphasize flexibility and multi-skilling
- Union roles follow defined classifications and wage scales

---

## Entry-Level, Journeyman, and Master: Different Approaches

### Apprentice/Helper Resume

You're new. That's fine. Emphasize:

- **Pre-apprenticeship or trade school coursework**
- **Hand tools and basic tasks** you can perform (under supervision)
- **Soft skills:** Show up on time, follow instructions, safety awareness
- **Physical capability and willingness to work**

Example bullet:
> "Assisted journeyman electricians with conduit installation, wire pulling, and material staging on commercial job sites"

### Journeyman Resume

You can work independently. Show it:

- **State journey license and code knowledge**
- **Ability to read plans and work independently**
- **Coordination with other trades**
- **Leading small crews** (if applicable)
- **Quantified results** — projects, inspections passed, callbacks reduced

Example bullet:
> "Independently completed residential service upgrades and panel replacements, averaging 3 per week with 100% inspection pass rate"

### Master Tradesperson Resume

You're at the top. Emphasize:

- **License level** — Master Electrician, Master Plumber, etc.
- **Ability to pull permits and supervise installations**
- **Project management, estimating, and client management**
- **Training and mentoring** apprentices
- **Safety leadership**

Example bullet:
> "Supervised crew of 8 plumbers on hospital renovation project, managing scheduling, inspections, and apprentice training while maintaining zero safety incidents"

## Common Mistakes That Get Trades Resumes Rejected

### 1. Only Listing Job Duties

**Bad:** "Did electrical work on construction sites"

**Good:** "Installed 200A residential service panels to NEC code with zero failed inspections"

### 2. Missing Licenses or Certifications

If the job requires a license and you don't list yours clearly, you're out. State it prominently with issuing authority.

### 3. Generic Skills Sections

**Bad:** "Hard worker, team player, fast learner"

**Good:** "MIG/TIG welding, 6G pipe certified, ASME Section IX qualified, carbon and stainless steel"

### 4. No Project Context

Don't just list employers. Show what you built, how big it was, what systems you worked on.

### 5. Unexplained Gaps or Short Stints

Construction work can be project-based, and that's normal. But if you have gaps or lots of short jobs, address it:
- Note if work was project-based or seasonal
- Group related short-term work together
- Be ready to explain in the interview

### 6. Safety Red Flags

Never mention serious safety incidents without context. If it comes up, frame it as a learning experience, not a pattern.

## Wisconsin Licensing Requirements

### Plumbers

Wisconsin requires a **DSPS plumbing credential** — Apprentice, Journeyman, or Master. Unlicensed individuals generally cannot install plumbing except in limited circumstances.

### HVAC

Businesses installing or servicing HVAC must hold a **Registered HVAC Contractor** credential statewide (Wis. Admin. Code SPS 305.70). Anyone handling refrigerants needs **EPA 608 certification.**

### Electricians

DSPS issues credentials for Apprentice, Journeyman, and Master Electricians. **Dwelling Contractor Qualifier** certification is required for those supervising residential electrical work. Both classroom hours and experience plus exams are required.

### Wisconsin Apprenticeship Programs

State-registered apprenticeships (through DSPS and trade associations like PHCC-WI, NECA, ABC) require thousands of OJT hours plus classroom training, leading to journeyman and master exams.

**How to list:**
> **Registered Electrical Apprentice** — DSPS / IBEW Local 494  
> 4,000+ OJT hours, 576 hours related instruction

## Industry Demand: Why This Matters

### The Shortage Is Real

The U.S. faces a significant skilled trades shortage:
- Tens of thousands of trade job openings projected through 2033
- Roughly **66,600 new electrician openings** expected
- Welding growth around **12%** over the decade
- HVAC and plumbing growth around **5%**
- Older workers retiring faster than new ones enter

### What This Means for You

Demand is high. Employers are struggling to fill licensed positions. A clear, professional resume with documented skills and credentials puts you ahead of the competition.

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need a resume if I'm in a union?

Yes. It helps for foreman/supervisor roles, contractor requests for specific skills, and work outside the hall. Keep it current.

### How do I list multiple short-term construction jobs?

Group them by trade or contractor if they're similar. Note that work was project-based. Focus on the scope and skills, not just the dates.

### Should I list every project I've worked on?

No. Highlight the most impressive or relevant ones. Show variety (residential, commercial, industrial) and scope.

### What if I don't have my journeyman license yet?

List your apprentice status with hours completed. Show progression and what you can do under supervision. Employers hire apprentices too.

### How long should my trades resume be?

One page for most workers. Two pages if you're a master tradesperson with extensive project management experience.

### Should I include references?

Don't list them on the resume. "References available upon request" is optional. Have them ready when asked — ideally journeymen or foremen you've worked under.

## The Bottom Line

Your skills are valuable. The shortage is real. Employers need you.

But they need to see it on paper:

- **Licenses and certifications** — Clear, specific, verifiable
- **Skills** — Name the actual techniques, tools, and systems
- **Projects** — Type, size, scope, your role
- **Metrics** — Numbers that show quality and productivity
- **Safety** — A record that shows you're not a risk

Don't undersell yourself with generic job duties. Show them what you've built.
