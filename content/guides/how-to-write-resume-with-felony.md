# How to Write a Resume with a Felony

*Your record is part of your history. It doesn't have to be the end of your story.*

---

You have a felony on your record. You need a job. And you're wondering if there's even a point to writing a resume when you know that background check is coming.

Here's the truth: **93% of employers run background checks.** That number isn't going down. Pretending your record doesn't exist isn't a strategy — it's a time bomb.

But here's the other truth: **Major companies like Walmart, Target, Starbucks, CVS Health, and Tyson Foods have explicit second-chance hiring programs.** There are employers who will hire you. The question is whether your resume gets you in front of them — and whether you know how to handle the conversation when it comes up.

This guide is going to show you exactly how to do both.

## What Employers Actually See (And When)

Before you write a single word on your resume, you need to understand what's actually happening on the employer's side.

### The Timeline of a Background Check

Most employers don't run a background check until **after** they've decided they want you. Here's the typical sequence:

1. **Application** — They see your resume
2. **Interview** — They meet you, ask questions
3. **Conditional offer** — They say "you're hired, pending background check"
4. **Background check** — They run your record
5. **Final decision** — They decide if the record is a dealbreaker

This matters because your resume's job is to get you to step 2 (the interview), not to confess your entire life story at step 1.

### How Far Back Do Background Checks Go?

It depends on the state and the type of check:

- **Federal law (FCRA)** allows reporting of criminal convictions indefinitely for most positions
- **Some states limit reporting to 7 years:** California, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, and Washington
- **Hawaii limits felonies to 7 years** and misdemeanors to 5 years
- **Wisconsin has no time limit** on reporting convictions

In practice, most employment background checks look back **7-10 years** for standard positions. Longer for positions involving financial responsibility, healthcare, or working with vulnerable populations.

## Ban the Box: What It Actually Means

You've probably heard the term "Ban the Box." Here's what it actually does — and doesn't do.

### What Ban the Box Laws Require

As of 2025, **37 states and over 150 cities/counties** have some form of Ban the Box or fair-chance hiring policy. These laws typically:

- **Remove the criminal history checkbox** from the initial job application
- **Delay background check inquiries** until after an interview or conditional offer
- **Require individualized assessment** — meaning employers can't use blanket "no felons" policies

### What Ban the Box Laws Don't Do

- They **don't prevent** employers from ever asking about your record
- They **don't force** employers to hire you
- They **don't erase** your conviction

Ban the Box changes the **timing** of when employers can ask. It doesn't change the fact that they'll eventually find out.

### Wisconsin's Rules (Private vs. Public Employers)

**Wisconsin does not have a statewide Ban the Box law for private employers.** Private employers can ask about your criminal history at any point in the application process.

However, Wisconsin law does protect you from **discrimination based on arrest and conviction record** under certain circumstances:

- Employers can only consider convictions that are **"substantially related"** to the job
- Employers **cannot refuse to hire** based solely on an arrest record (arrests without conviction)
- Employers can consider pending charges only if substantially related to the job duties

**For public employers** (state government jobs), Wisconsin removed conviction questions from applications in 2016. You won't see the box on state job applications, and criminal history inquiries are delayed until you're certified for the position.

**Local policies:** Madison and Dane County have their own Ban the Box policies for public employers.

## Your Resume: What Goes On It (And What Doesn't)

Your resume is a marketing document, not a confession booth. Here's how to think about it.

### The Golden Rule

**Your resume should never mention your criminal record.** Not in your summary. Not in your cover letter. Not anywhere.

Why? Because:
1. You're giving them a reason to reject you before they've met you
2. You're wasting valuable resume space on something negative
3. You're making the conversation about your past instead of your future

The resume gets you to the interview. The interview is where you handle the hard questions.

### What Your Resume Should Emphasize

Focus on **transferable skills, work ethic, and reliability** — the exact things employers worry about when they see a record:

**Skills that translate everywhere:**
- Physical stamina and work ethic
- Following safety procedures
- Meeting deadlines and quotas
- Working on teams
- Problem-solving under pressure
- Operating equipment (list specific types)

**Metrics that prove reliability:**
- Attendance records
- Safety record (days without incident)
- Production numbers or speed
- Customer satisfaction or quality scores

**Certifications that show investment:**
- Forklift certification
- OSHA safety training
- Food handler's card
- CDL (if applicable)
- Any industry-specific training

### Handling Employment Gaps

If you were incarcerated, you'll have a gap. Here are your options:

**Option 1: List it vaguely**
Instead of leaving a blank gap, you can list:
- "Personal development and education" 
- "Family responsibilities"
- "Career transition period"

This isn't lying — it's just not volunteering information that wasn't asked for.

**Option 2: Show what you did inside**
If you completed programs, got certifications, or worked while incarcerated, you can list those:

> **GED Completion** | [State] Department of Corrections | 2021
>
> **Forklift Certification** | Completed during work release program | 2022

Some candidates list work performed during incarceration without specifying the context. A job in the prison kitchen is still food service experience.

**Option 3: Use a functional resume format**
Instead of listing jobs chronologically, a functional resume groups your experience by skill area. This de-emphasizes dates and gaps while highlighting what you can do.

## When They Ask: Scripts That Actually Work

At some point — on the application, in the interview, or when they run the background check — someone will ask about your record. Here's how to handle each scenario.

### If the Application Asks Directly

In states without Ban the Box for private employers (like Wisconsin), you might see the question on the application.

**Do not lie.** Lying on an application is grounds for immediate termination, even years later if they discover it. But you can be strategic:

**For "Have you ever been convicted of a felony?" checkboxes:**
- Check "Yes" if you have a conviction
- If there's a space for explanation, keep it brief: "I'm happy to discuss in an interview"

**For "Explain any criminal convictions" boxes:**
Keep it to one or two sentences:

> "I was convicted of [general category] in [year]. Since then, I have [specific positive action]. I'm fully committed to [relevant to this job]."

Example:
> "I was convicted of a drug-related offense in 2019. Since then, I've completed treatment, maintained sobriety, and earned my forklift certification. I'm fully committed to being a reliable, long-term employee."

### If They Ask in the Interview

This is actually your best-case scenario. You have a chance to make an impression before the record comes up, and you can control the narrative.

**The 30-Second Framework:**
1. **Acknowledge briefly** (2-3 seconds)
2. **Take responsibility** (5 seconds)
3. **Pivot to what's changed** (10 seconds)
4. **Connect to this job** (10 seconds)

**Example script:**

> "Yes, I have a felony on my record from [year]. I made a serious mistake, and I've taken full responsibility for it. Since then, I've [specific changes: completed treatment, maintained employment, gotten certified, etc.]. What I'm focused on now is being the most reliable, hardest-working person on your team. That's why I'm here — I want to prove myself through my work."

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't over-explain or give your whole life story
- Don't blame others or make excuses
- Don't get emotional or defensive
- Don't bring it up repeatedly — say it once and move on

### If the Background Check Comes Back

Sometimes you'll get the interview, nail it, get a conditional offer — and then the background check comes back. The employer may call you to discuss.

**Your goal:** Give them the confidence to proceed with the hire.

**Script for the phone call:**

> "Thank you for giving me a chance to discuss this. I was upfront about my record because I believe in honesty, and I understand you need to do your due diligence. What I can tell you is that I've spent the last [X years] working on becoming someone you can count on. I've [specific proof: held steady employment, completed programs, maintained clean record, etc.]. I want this job because [specific reason], and I'm prepared to work harder than anyone to prove I was the right choice."

## Industries That Actually Hire

Not every industry is equally open to second-chance candidates. Here's where your odds are best — and worst.

### More Likely to Hire

**Manufacturing & Warehouse**
- High turnover means constant need for workers
- Focus is on reliability and physical ability
- Many companies participate in second-chance initiatives
- Examples: Tyson Foods, Amazon (varies by facility)

**Food Service**
- Similar high turnover, constant hiring
- Experience matters more than background
- Back-of-house positions especially accessible

**Construction & Skilled Trades**
- Desperate for workers
- Skills and certifications carry weight
- Many small contractors don't run checks
- Focus: Can you do the job safely?

**Transportation & Delivery**
- CDL drivers in high demand
- Record matters for driving-related offenses (DUI especially)
- Non-driving delivery and warehouse roles more accessible

### More Difficult (But Not Impossible)

**Healthcare**
- Heavily regulated, especially for direct patient care
- Nursing homes and hospitals have strict requirements
- Non-clinical roles (housekeeping, food service, maintenance) may be accessible

**Financial Services**
- Federal regulations bar certain convictions
- Back-office and support roles may be possible

**Working with Children**
- Sexual offenses are automatic disqualifiers
- Other offenses may be case-by-case

**Government Jobs**
- State and federal jobs have their own rules
- Many require security clearances that won't pass

### Major Second-Chance Employers

The **Second Chance Business Coalition** includes over 50 major corporations committed to fair-chance hiring. Some of the biggest names:

- Walmart
- Target
- Starbucks
- Best Buy
- CVS Health
- Tyson Foods
- Koch Industries
- Microsoft
- Lyft
- Uber
- PepsiCo
- Coca-Cola

These companies have removed criminal history questions from initial applications and train hiring managers on individualized assessment.

## Wisconsin Resources: Where to Get Help

### State Programs

**Wisconsin Department of Corrections Reentry Unit**
- Employment resources for people transitioning from incarceration
- Information on CQE (Certificate of Qualification for Employment)
- Connects to federal bonding programs and tax incentives for employers

**Certificate of Qualification for Employment (CQE)**
Wisconsin offers a CQE that can:
- Provide limited relief from statutory bars related to your conviction
- Give employers liability protection for hiring you
- Help with licensing issues in certain fields

### Milwaukee/Waukesha Area

**Employ Milwaukee**
- Reentry-focused employment programs
- Job training and placement services
- Partnerships with employers who hire second-chance candidates
- Contact: employmilwaukee.org

**Wisconsin Community Services — Center for Driver's License Recovery and Employability**
- Helps with license issues that block employment
- Part of United Way's barrier-reduction programs

**United Way of Greater Milwaukee & Waukesha County**
Multiple funded programs including:
- Industry Access and Advancement Initiative
- Goodwill CNA Program
- Milwaukee Christian Center YouthBuild
- Milwaukee Community Service Corps

### Expungement: Is It an Option?

Wisconsin's expungement laws are **narrow**, but worth checking:

**Current law requires:**
- Offense committed when you were **under age 25**
- Certain misdemeanors and non-violent felonies only
- Maximum penalty of **6 years or less**
- Judge must have ordered expungement possibility **at sentencing**
- Successful completion of sentence without violations

**Proposed changes** would expand eligibility, but as of early 2026, the current restrictions still apply. If you think you might qualify, consult with a criminal defense attorney.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Should I bring up my record in the interview if they don't ask?

**Generally, no.** If they don't ask and there's no application question, focus on selling yourself. They'll find out during the background check, and you can address it then if needed. Don't volunteer negative information.

### What if I lie and they find out later?

You'll be fired. Potentially immediately. Even if it's years later. The lie is usually a bigger problem than the original offense. Don't do it.

### Can an employer legally refuse to hire me because of my record?

Yes, in most cases — but with limits. They can't use blanket "no felons" policies in many jurisdictions. In Wisconsin, they can only consider convictions that are "substantially related" to the job. If you're rejected and believe it was discriminatory, you can file a complaint with the Wisconsin DWD.

### How long do I have to disclose my record?

Until it's expunged or sealed, it's on your record. There's no "it falls off after 7 years" for employment purposes in Wisconsin. The good news: the older it is, the less weight it typically carries.

### Should I use a resume service?

If you're struggling to frame your experience positively, a professional can help. Look for someone who understands second-chance hiring — not just generic resume templates. [Steel Man Resumes specializes in exactly this situation.](/forge)

## The Bottom Line

Having a felony on your record makes the job search harder. Not impossible — harder.

Your resume is one piece of the puzzle. It gets you in the door. From there, your honesty, your attitude, and your ability to demonstrate what you've learned will determine whether you get hired.

Don't hide from your past. Don't over-explain it. Own it, frame it, and move forward.

There are employers who will give you a chance. Your job is to be ready when you find them.
