Gaps of 3+ years significantly hurt your chances — callback rates drop to under 5%. The median unemployment spell in 2024 was 9.6 weeks, so short gaps are increasingly normalized."

They're not judging your character — they're wondering if you'll be a reliable employee. Your job is to address those specific concerns."

Don't over-explain, don't get emotional, don't blame others, and don't leave it unexplained."

                    "text": "Absolutely. Listing volunteer roles, freelance projects, gig work, or part-time work during gaps shows you stayed active and counters concerns about skill decay and work ethic. Even informal work counts — DoorDash is logistics and customer service, TaskRabbit is problem-solving and reliability."

However, they cannot use gaps as a pretext for discrimination based on disability (ADA), FMLA-protected leave, or association with someone who has a disability. If your gap was for a protected reason and you were rejected 'because of the gap,' that could be illegal."

One in five job seekers in 2023 reported a gap of one year or longer, up from 14% in 2020. In 2024, 37% of unemployed people were out of work for 15+ weeks. You're not alone."
