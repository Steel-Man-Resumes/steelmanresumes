These laws don't prevent employers from ever asking about your record — they change WHEN they can ask, pushing the question later in the hiring process after you've had a chance to show your qualifications."

However, only about 15 states extend these protections to private employers: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington."

However, Wisconsin law prohibits discrimination based on arrest or conviction record — employers can only reject you if the conviction is 'substantially related' to the job duties."

For example: theft conviction for a cashier position, or OWI for a truck driver. If there's no clear connection, the employer cannot legally reject you based on that conviction."

Many state and local fair-chance laws explicitly prohibit blanket bans and require case-by-case individualized assessment.

Before rejecting someone based on a criminal record, employers must consider: (1) nature and gravity of the offense, (2) time elapsed since the offense, and (3) nature of the job and its duties.
