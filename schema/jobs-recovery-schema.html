Early recovery especially requires caution with alcohol-adjacent work."

If you need schedule flexibility, you may need to disclose to HR that you have a medical need (not necessarily full details). The ADA protects you from discrimination based on recovery status."

However, if you voluntarily seek treatment and haven't violated workplace rules, terminating you solely for having a relapse or seeking help may be ADA discrimination."
