You will address your record when asked during the hiring process, but volunteering it upfront gives employers a reason to reject you before they've met you."

As of 2025, 37 states have some form of Ban the Box. Wisconsin does NOT have a statewide Ban the Box law for private employers, but does have it for public (government) employers. Madison and Dane County have their own local policies."

In Wisconsin, employers can only consider convictions that are 'substantially related' to the job duties. They also cannot refuse to hire based solely on arrest records (arrests without conviction). If you believe you were discriminated against, you can file a complaint with the Wisconsin DWD."
